Activity Diagram:
An activity diagram is used to describe the flow of activities or actions that occur within a system. It is a type of behavior diagram that depicts the steps, actions, and decision points involved in a process.
In an ATM system, an activity diagram could depict the flow of activities involved in withdrawing money. It could include steps such as entering the PIN, selecting the amount to withdraw, verifying the balance, dispensing the cash, and updating the account balance.

State Machine Diagram:
A state machine diagram is used to represent the various states that an object or system can be in and how it transitions from one state to another. It is a type of behavior diagram that shows the dynamic behavior of a system.
In an ATM system, a state machine diagram could represent the various states that the ATM machine could be in, such as "idle", "waiting for card", "verifying PIN", "dispensing cash", "updating account balance", and so on.

Use Case Diagram:
A use case diagram is used to represent the interactions between a system and its users or external entities. It depicts the various use cases or scenarios that a system can be used for.
In an ATM system, a use case diagram could depict the various use cases that a user can perform, such as "withdraw money", "check balance", "change PIN", and so on.

Communication Diagram:
A communication diagram is used to depict the interactions between objects or components within a system. It shows the messages that are exchanged between objects and the order in which they are exchanged.
In an ATM system, a communication diagram could depict the interactions between the ATM machine, the user, the bank, and other external entities.

Interaction Overview Diagram:
An interaction overview diagram is used to depict the high-level interactions between objects or components within a system. It shows the various interactions and how they relate to each other.
In an ATM system, an interaction overview diagram could depict the high-level interactions involved in performing a transaction, such as "entering the PIN", "verifying the balance", "dispensing the cash", and so on.

Sequence Diagram:
A sequence diagram is used to depict the interactions between objects or components within a system in a chronological order. It shows the messages that are exchanged between objects and the order in which they are exchanged.
In an ATM system, a sequence diagram could depict the sequence of events involved in withdrawing money, such as "entering the PIN", "verifying the balance", "dispensing the cash", and so on.

Timing Diagram:
A timing diagram is used to depict the timing constraints and dependencies between objects or components within a system. It shows the timing of events and how they relate to each other.

Class Diagram:
A class diagram is used to depict the structure of a system in terms of its classes, their attributes, and their relationships. It provides a static view of the system and helps in identifying the various components and their relationships.
In an ATM system, a class diagram could depict the various classes such as "ATM", "User", "Bank", "Transaction", and their attributes and relationships.

Composite Structure Diagram:
A composite structure diagram is used to depict the internal structure of a class or component. It shows the parts that make up a class or component and how they are related to each other.
In an ATM system, a composite structure diagram could depict the internal structure of the "ATM" class, showing the various components such as "card reader", "display", "keypad", and how they are connected to each other.

Component Diagram:
A component diagram is used to depict the physical components of a system and how they are connected to each other. It shows the various software and hardware components and their relationships.
In an ATM system, a component diagram could depict the various components such as "ATM machine", "server", "database", "cash dispenser", and how they are connected to each other.

Deployment Diagram:
A deployment diagram is used to depict the physical deployment of a system on hardware components. It shows the various nodes and their relationships, such as servers, computers, and other hardware components.
In an ATM system, a deployment diagram could depict the various nodes such as "ATM machine", "server", "database server", "backup server", and their relationships.

Object Diagram:
An object diagram is used to depict a snapshot of the system at a particular point in time. It shows the various objects and their relationships at a given moment.
In an ATM system, an object diagram could depict the various objects such as "ATM machine", "user", "bank", "transaction", and their relationships at a particular point in time.

Package Diagram:
A package diagram is used to depict the various packages or modules that make up a system and how they are related to each other. It shows the various components of a system and their relationships.
In an ATM system, a package diagram could depict the various packages such as "user interface", "transaction processing", "database access", and their relationships.
